# Overview

Eternal Power Calculator is a tool to assist the deckbuilding process
for Dire Wolf Digital's Eternal CCG.

See https://www.direwolfdigital.com/eternal/ for more about Eternal.

Given a decklist, the power calculator will compute the probability of
drawing the power and influence necessary to play cards from the deck
in a particular number of cards drawn.  It will generate an HTML table
of the odds of drawing those cards for each of set of influence
required by cards in the deck.

Eternal Power Calculator uses jQuery and Semantic-UI as a foundation.
See the following for more information:
